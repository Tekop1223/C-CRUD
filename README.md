# C-CRUD
This is a CRUD with CREATE DELETE and EDIT buttons 
in this CRUD I have used WPF as Frontend, MSSQL as DataBase & in the code I have used EF core as the Link between the frontend and DB, some linq to group it together.

To use the CRATE button just enter firstname & lastname in the correct inputbox, then press on the CREATE button

To use the DELETE button select the correct name by clicking on it, then clicking on the DELETE button

To use the EDIT button select the correct name & then changing it in the input box, then click on the EDIT button again
